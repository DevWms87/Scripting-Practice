# CyberBootCampPractice
These are some scripts I created while working through a Cyber Security Boot Camp.  They contain
python files as well as shell scripts created within the command line.  I have separated the files
into the folders with the corresponding names as to what they do.  There are either comments in the 
shell files or a PDF file (containing screenshots and comments) that help explain what they do.
